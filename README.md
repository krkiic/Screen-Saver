# displej-varanje


Screen Saver is a simple Windows Forms application written in C#.

It was a project I completed a long time ago for the purpose of cheating in school (although I never actually used it for this purpose).

When the program is running, clicking the space bar will turn off the display and pressing it again will turn it back on.

This project serves as an example of my early programming skills and is not meant to be used for any unethical purposes.
